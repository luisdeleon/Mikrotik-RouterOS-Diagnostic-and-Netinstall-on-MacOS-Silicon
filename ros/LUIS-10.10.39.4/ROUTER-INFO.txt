Configuration:      Will be set up by optimization script if hardware exists

Expected Configuration After Optimization:
  SSID:             SatLink-2G-2ndFloor
  Security:         WPA2-PSK
  Password:         anabela2013
  Channel Width:    20MHz (forced for stability)
  Band:             2.4GHz only (legacy hardware)

PERFORMANCE METRICS
-------------------
CPU Load:           26% (single-core MIPS)
CPU Type:           MIPS AR7161 @ 680MHz
Memory:             256 MB total
Uptime:             16 minutes (just rebooted)
Storage:            128 MB NAND with 3% bad blocks
Write Sectors:      Monitor for excessive writes

ISSUES IDENTIFIED
-----------------
CRITICAL:
1. Storage has 3% bad blocks
   Impact: Hardware degradation, risk of failure
   Solution: Weekly backups, monthly monitoring, plan replacement
   Timeline: Replace if bad blocks exceed 5%

2. WiFi not configured
   Impact: Device not functioning as access point
   Solution: Configure basic WiFi with legacy wireless package
   Note: May not have WiFi hardware (check device)

MAJOR:
3. Single-core CPU at 26% load
   Impact: Limited processing capacity
   Solution: Optimize for single-core, avoid heavy tasks
   Note: This is hardware limitation, not a bug

4. Recent reboot (16 min uptime)
   Impact: Possible instability or power issues
   Solution: Enable watchdog, monitor for frequent reboots
   Action: Check power supply and connection

5. Using legacy wireless package
   Impact: Limited WiFi features compared to modern wifi-qcom
   Solution: Use legacy commands, accept limitations
   Note: Hardware incompatible with wifi-qcom

MODERATE:
6. Old firmware (7.16.1)
   Impact: Missing latest features and bug fixes
   Solution: Consider upgrade to 7.20.4+ (test thoroughly first)
   Caution: Legacy hardware - test before production

LOW:
7. No monitoring configured
   Impact: Issues not detected proactively
   Solution: Add storage and resource monitoring
