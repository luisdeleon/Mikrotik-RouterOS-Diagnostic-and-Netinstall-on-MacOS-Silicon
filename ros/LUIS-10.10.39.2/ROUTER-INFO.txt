  Channel Width:    20/40/80MHz
  Band:             5GHz-AC
  Current Issue:    Should have more clients (band steering needed)

WIFI CLIENTS (at diagnostic time)
----------------------------------
Total Clients:      14 connected
2.4GHz Clients:     Most clients on 2.4GHz
5GHz Clients:       Few clients on 5GHz
Weak Signals:       14 clients with signals -87 to -99 dBm (CRITICAL)
Band Distribution:  Poor - too many on 2.4GHz with weak signals

SIGNAL QUALITY BREAKDOWN
-------------------------
Excellent (>-60 dBm):     0 clients
Good (-60 to -70 dBm):    0 clients
Fair (-70 to -80 dBm):    0 clients
Poor (-80 to -90 dBm):    10 clients
Very Poor (<-90 dBm):     4 clients

WIFI ACCESS LIST (Blocked Devices)
-----------------------------------
Several Amazon Echo devices blocked from 2.4GHz
(Access list configured to reject specific MAC addresses)

PERFORMANCE METRICS
-------------------
CPU Load:           Low (access point role)
Memory Usage:       Moderate
Uptime:             Variable (power outage history)
Storage:            Adequate

ISSUES IDENTIFIED
-----------------
CRITICAL:
1. Very weak WiFi signals on all 14 clients (-87 to -99 dBm)
   Impact: Poor performance, frequent disconnects, slow speeds
   Solution: Fix channel width, improve power settings, AP repositioning

2. 2.4GHz using 20/40MHz width
   Impact: Instability, interference, channel overlap
   Solution: Force 20MHz width for 2.4GHz

MAJOR:
3. Poor band steering / client distribution
   Impact: Capable devices stuck on 2.4GHz with poor performance
   Solution: Enable band steering, encourage 5GHz usage

4. Login failures in logs
   Impact: Security concern, possible brute force attempts
   Solution: Harden security, change SSH port, restrict access

5. Power outage history
   Impact: Reliability concerns, lost configuration risk
   Solution: Enable watchdog, ensure UPS power if possible

MODERATE:
6. Old firmware (7.16.1)
   Impact: Missing latest WiFi improvements and bug fixes
   Solution: Upgrade to 7.20.4 or later (after testing)

7. WPA2 only (no WPA3)
   Impact: Less secure than modern standards
   Solution: Enable WPA3 with WPA2 fallback

LOW:
8. No automated monitoring
   Impact: Issues not detected proactively
   Solution: Add WiFi monitoring script

OPTIMIZATION PRIORITY
---------------------
Priority 1: Fix 2.4GHz channel width (20MHz only)
Priority 2: Improve WiFi signal strength (power/placement)
Priority 3: Enable band steering
Priority 4: Security hardening (SSH, access restrictions)
Priority 5: Enable WPA3 security
Priority 6: Add monitoring and alerting
Priority 7: System stability (watchdog)

ROOT CAUSES ANALYSIS
--------------------
Weak WiFi Signals:
  - Possible Causes:
    1. AP mounted in poor location (too low, corner, etc.)
    2. Channel width causing interference (20/40MHz)
    3. Power settings too conservative
    4. Physical obstructions (walls, furniture)
    5. Distance from clients too far
  - Solutions:
    1. Optimize channel settings (force 20MHz)
    2. Adjust transmit power if needed
    3. Consider AP repositioning or additional APs
    4. Enable band steering to move clients to 5GHz

Poor Band Distribution:
  - Possible Causes:
    1. No band steering enabled
    2. Devices defaulting to 2.4GHz
    3. 5GHz signal weaker/coverage smaller
  - Solutions:
    1. Enable band steering
    2. Optimize 5GHz configuration
    3. Educate users to prefer 5GHz

EXPECTED RESULTS AFTER OPTIMIZATION
------------------------------------
Weak Signal Clients:    < 5 (from 14) - 65%+ improvement
2.4GHz Channel Width:   20MHz fixed (from 20/40MHz)
Band Distribution:      More balanced (more 5GHz clients)
Security Score:         High (from Medium)
WiFi Stability:         Improved significantly
Disconnects:            Minimal (from frequent)
Login Failures:         Stopped (SSH hardened)
Monitoring:             Active (proactive alerts)

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
IMMEDIATE:
1. Apply optimization script
2. Monitor WiFi client signals for 24 hours
3. Identify persistent weak signal areas

SHORT-TERM:
4. Consider AP repositioning if weak signals persist
5. Upgrade firmware to 7.20.4 (after backup)
6. Add UPS power if not present

LONG-TERM:
7. Deploy additional APs if coverage gaps remain
8. Create WiFi heat map to identify dead zones
9. Regular monitoring of client distribution

PHYSICAL PLACEMENT TIPS
------------------------
Current:            Unknown (likely suboptimal given weak signals)
Recommended:
  - Mount at ceiling height or high on wall
  - Central location in coverage area
  - Away from metal objects and appliances
  - Minimize walls between AP and clients
  - Consider separate APs for different floors
