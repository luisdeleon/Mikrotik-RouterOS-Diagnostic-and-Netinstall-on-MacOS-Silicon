Run interface diagnostics on all routers to check:
- All network interfaces status (up/down/disabled)
- Interface types (ethernet, wireless, bridge, etc.)
- Traffic statistics (RX/TX bytes and packets)

Execute: `npm start -- --category interfaces`

Useful for troubleshooting connectivity issues or monitoring traffic.
